# 🧬 VitalMatch

**VitalMatch** is a personal awareness website created to encourage  
**stem cell donor registration with DKMS-BMST India**.

This project focuses on **clarity, empathy, and trust** — helping people
understand stem cell donation without fear, pressure, or misinformation.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

VitalMatch exists **only for awareness**.

It does **not**:
- Collect user data
- Track visitors
- Replace official DKMS platforms
- Offer medical advice

It **does**:
- Explain stem cell donation in simple language
- Address common fears and myths
- Encourage informed, voluntary registration

All registrations redirect to the **official DKMS-BMST India website**.

---

## 🧠 Why VitalMatch?

Official websites explain *what* to do.  
VitalMatch explains *why people hesitate*.

Many potential donors don’t register because they fear:
- Pain or surgery
- Long-term health effects
- Hidden costs
- Commitment without clarity

VitalMatch was built to speak **human-to-human**, not institution-to-user.

---

## 🤖 Transparency (AI Usage)

VitalMatch was created **entirely using AI tools**.

Human involvement focused on:
- Defining intent and ethical boundaries
- Structuring content and UX flow
- Ensuring accuracy and responsible messaging
- Removing fear-based misinformation

AI handled execution.  
Human responsibility guided the outcome.

## ❤️ Final Note

VitalMatch was created as a personal initiative, not a campaign.

If it helps even **one person** understand stem cell donation better  
or encourages **one registration**, it has already served its purpose.
